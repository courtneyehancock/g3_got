				<h1>House Stark</h1>
				<p>House Stark of Winterfell is a Great House of Westeros, ruling over the vast region known as the North form their seat in Winterfell. It is one of the oldest lines of Westerosi nobility by far, claiming a line of descent stretching back over eight thousand years. Before the Targeryen conquest, as well as during the War of the Five Kings and Daenarys Targaryen's invasion of Westeros, the leaders of House Stark ruled over the region as the Kings in the North.</p>
				<p>Their rule in the North seemingly ended after the events of the Red Wedding when House Frey and House Bolton betrayed House Stark after forming a secret alliance with House Lannister, during which Roose Bolton murdered King Robb Stark. Both the North and Winterfell were taken over by House Bolton. However, the Bolton's hold was jeopardized when Sansa Stark escaped their clutches after learning her brothers Bran and Rickon Stark were still alive and reunited with her half-brother Jon Snow at Castle Black. Sansa and Jon marched on the Boltons to save their younger brother Rickon, who was later murdered by Ramsay Bolton, and retake their family home Winterfell. House Stark was restored to their former stature after the Battle of the Bastards. The Stark victory leg to House Stark's return to royal status in the North with their bannerman declaring Ned Stark's illegitimate son Jon Snow as the King of the North. He later abdicated his title as king in order to gain the full support of Daenarys Targeryen in the Great War, becoming the Warden of the North. </p>
